## Why does this exist

Square-cube pandigials ("nice" numbers) seem to be distributed pseudo-randomly. It doesn't take very long to check if a number is pandigital in a specific base, but even after we narrow the search range to numbers with the right amount of digits in their square and cube there's a lot of numbers to check. This system coordinates multiple clients to search more efficiently.
