                                We're looking for a specific kind of number
                                called square-cube pandigitals, or "nice
                                numbers". A number is "nice" if the digits in
                                its square and cube contain all possible values
                                with no repeats. Right now the only known nice
                                number is 69 (evaluated in base 10), but the
                                math says if we expand our search to other bases
                                there should be more, possibly infinitely many
                                more! This site is a summary of our progress so
                                far.

                            <p>
                                There are two main ways to help with this
                                project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first is to search a range yourself!
                                <a href="search">This page</a>
                                has a super convenient app that connects to a
                                central server and "checks out" a range to
                                search for nice numbers. If you let it run it
                                will show you the results and report back with
                                any results and credit those discoveries to your
                                name!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you're interested in running it even faster,
                                like with the old distributed computing
                                initiatives such as SETI@Home,
                                <a href="https://github.com/wasabipesto/nice"
                                    >this repository</a
                                >
                                has all the code which runs even faster directly
                                on your computer rather than a webapp.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second is to help with the math. This site
                                collects a lot of information from the clients,
                                such as a log of highly-nice numbers and the
                                "niceness" distribution for each range that you
                                can query for analysis. You can use that data to
                                find patterns or just attack the problem with
                                pure theory at one of the discussion links
                                below.
